# LED it BIG

LED it BIG is a project carried out by Tecnoateneu Vilablareix, a HackerSpace of Girona area
located in Vilablareix (village situated very close to Girona). The project was inspired by the
project called Flaschen Taschen by the Hackerspace Noisebridge in San Francisco.

The project consists of 64 units, each one hosts 48 PET bottles and 48 LEDâ€™s.

Each box is made with 4 mm MDF. 2 panels of 20 * 44,7 cm, 2 panels of 20 * 33 cm, 90 degree
wood angles and a back panel of 33 * 44 cm with 48 holes of 31 mm each. This structure is
glued by contact glue. The holes permit the passing of the bottle neck through it and then by
screwing the plastic cap the bottle gets fixed to the back panel. Each plastic cap has been
previously drilled an 8 mm hole, to enable the passing of the LED light. Another 4 mm MDF
panel of 33 * 44 cm supports the 48 individual LED WS2811. Each LED is attached to the MDF
panel using its self-adhesive properties. The LED matrix is created by drawing a pen line
parallel to the short and long edge at 2,75 cm of the edge and from this line drawing parallel
lines at 5,5 cm. You can get a better idea by looking at the pictures.

The diameter of each PET bottle is 5,5 cm.

The final structure is composed by piling up the boxes, making a final matrix of 8 boxes wide
and 6 boxes height.
